# 👋 Hi, I’m Sajan Maharjan

## 🚀 About Me

---

**I am an aspiring PhD applicant in Computer Science with a strong research interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Electronic, Communication, and Information Engineering, and my academic path has evolved from application-driven development to research-focused problem solving.**

**My work spans deep learning–based modeling for NLP and computer vision, including experience with CNNs, Transformers, object detection frameworks (YOLO), and multimodal learning. I enjoy working with real-world datasets, designing reproducible experiments, and systematically evaluating model performance.**

**Through research and industry internships, I have developed a strong foundation in Python-based ML pipelines, data preprocessing, and experimental analysis. I am particularly interested in NLP-driven intelligent systems and multimodal AI, and I aim to pursue doctoral training where I can contribute to impactful, theory-driven research.**
